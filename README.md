# nux - Native macOS Terminal with AI-Powered Intelligence

## What is nux?

**nux** is a revolutionary, native macOS terminal application built entirely with SwiftUI that reimagines the traditional command-line experience by integrating cutting-edge AI capabilities with a modern, intuitive interface. Unlike conventional terminals that focus solely on command execution, nux transforms the terminal into an intelligent, context-aware development environment that understands your workflow and provides proactive assistance.

## Core Concept & Innovation

nux represents a paradigm shift in terminal design by treating the command line as a conversational interface rather than just a command executor. It combines the power and flexibility of traditional Unix tools with the intelligence of modern AI models, creating a development environment that learns from your patterns, anticipates your needs, and provides contextual guidance.

## What nux Does

### 1. **Intelligent Terminal Interface**

- **Bottom-aligned Output Flow**: Unlike traditional terminals that scroll from top to bottom, nux presents output in a chat-like interface where new content appears at the bottom, similar to modern messaging applications. This creates a natural reading flow that matches how users consume information.
- **Command Metadata Visualization**: Each command execution displays rich metadata including working directory, execution time, and exit status in a clean, organized format that never interferes with the actual output.
- **Session-based Architecture**: Commands are grouped into logical sessions with persistent context, allowing users to maintain separate workflows for different projects or tasks.

### 2. **AI-Powered Development Assistant**

- **Contextual Command Understanding**: nux analyzes your command history and current working context to provide intelligent suggestions and explanations.
- **Real-time Error Analysis**: When commands fail, nux automatically analyzes the error output and provides actionable solutions, explanations, and alternative approaches.
- **Workflow Optimization**: The AI learns from your command patterns and suggests optimizations, shortcuts, and best practices specific to your development workflow.
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can ask questions about their terminal session in plain English, and nux will provide contextual answers based on the current state and history.

### 3. **Advanced Autocomplete & Navigation**

- **Intelligent Command Suggestions**: Beyond basic tab completion, nux provides context-aware suggestions based on your current directory, recent commands, and project structure.
- **Ghost Text Preview**: As you type, nux shows a preview of the complete command, allowing for faster command construction and validation.
- **Fuzzy Search**: Navigate through command history, files, and directories using natural language queries and fuzzy matching algorithms.

### 4. **Modern User Experience**

- **Theme System**: Comprehensive theming with modern color schemes including Dark, Classic, Cyberpunk, Dracula, Nord, Solarized, Tokyo Night, and Gruvbox themes that persist across sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with SwiftUI for native macOS performance, smooth animations, and responsive interactions that feel natural on Apple hardware.
- **Accessibility**: Full support for VoiceOver, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility features built into the macOS ecosystem.

### 5. **Session Management & Organization**

- **Renameable Tabs**: Organize your work with descriptive tab names that persist across sessions.
- **Session Persistence**: All terminal state, including command history, working directories, and AI context, is preserved between application launches.
- **Multi-project Support**: Seamlessly switch between different development projects with separate terminal sessions that maintain their own context and history.

## Technical Architecture & Implementation
